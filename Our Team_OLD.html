                            The data visualization website for SCOAR is the result of <strong>interdisciplinary collaboration</strong> between professors and Ph.D. students 
                            in engineering, information science, neuroscience, and rehabilitation. Below, we provide a brief introduction to our team members below:</p>

								<b>Keith Lohse, PhD</b>
								<br>
									Keith is the principal investigator of the Rehabilitation Informatics Lab at Auburn University. 
									He received a joint PhD in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience in 2012 from the University of Colorado and was a 
									post-doctoral research associate at the University of British Columbia. The evidence-base in rehabilitation is always expanding. Researchers, 
									clinicians, and other stakeholders need effective tools for collecting, managing, analyzing, and visualizing data. 
									This need is especially urgent as the scale of our information grows and fields embrace progressively “bigger” data. As such, the goal of Keith's 
									research is to help improve methods for data collection, management, and analysis in rehabilitation research and, ultimately, to improve the quality 
									of life for individuals with disabilities.
